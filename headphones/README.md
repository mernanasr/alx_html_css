## Project: Headphones Responsive Webpage

### Overview
This project is a responsive webpage for showcasing headphones, designed with a sleek user interface and adaptable layout. The page automatically switches to a mobile-friendly version when the screen width is 480px or less, ensuring an excellent user experience across devices.

### Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly for screens of various sizes, switching to a mobile-friendly version at widths of 480px or less.
- **Hover/Active Effects**:
  - Links change color to `#FF6565` on hover or active.
  - Buttons adjust their opacity to `0.9` when hovered or active.
- **Dynamic Sections**:
  - Header with a hero image.
  - "What we do..." section with custom font icons and animations.
  - "Our results" section featuring CSS-drawn pentagons and hover animations.
  - Contact form with field constraints and smooth animations.
  - Footer with clean navigation links.
- **Animations**:
  - Cards in the "What we do..." section scale up on hover.
  - Pentagon shapes in "Our results" rotate and scale on hover.
  - Smooth fade-in animations for elements on page load.

### Key Design Considerations
1. **Responsive Breakpoints**:
   - A media query is used to switch to the mobile layout at `480px`.
2. **Hover and Active Styles**:
   - Links and buttons include interactive styling for better user engagement.
3. **CSS-Drawn Shapes**:
   - Pentagon shapes in the "Our results" section are drawn using `clip-path`.
4. **Animations**:
   - Elements feature hover animations and page-load animations for a dynamic experience.
