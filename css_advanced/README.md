# Project: ALX HTML & CSS Advanced

## Objective
The focus of this project is on CSS and styling the page based on the provided design. You'll use the Figma file as a reference and incorporate the images, fonts, and other design assets to replicate the final result accurately.

## Resources
- **Figma Design**: [Page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/xxrxA9zYkautRePyNrp0cO/Homepage-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=kXTxTGurDQH9QgDW-1)
  - Ensure you have a Figma account to duplicate the design to your drafts for detailed access.
- **Fonts**: 
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](font-download-link)
- **Images**: Download the required images [here](images-download-link).

## Tasks
1. **Write a README.md**
   - Include project objectives, resources, and usage instructions.

2. **Create index.html**
   - Start with the HTML code provided in the "HTML, Advanced" concept page.
   - Make any necessary updates to the code (e.g., adding image tags for logos).

3. **Style the page**
   - Use CSS to replicate the design from the Figma file.
   - If the design specifies float values, feel free to round them.

## Important Notes
- Ensure your computer has the required fonts installed. If not, download them from the links above.
- Replicate the design as closely as possible, paying attention to margins, paddings, font sizes, and colors.
- Organize your files into the following structure:
  ```
  alx_html_css/
  ├── css_advanced/
      ├── README.md
      ├── index.html
      ├── styles.css (optional, for additional CSS)
      ├── assets/
          ├── images/
          ├── fonts/
  ```

## Submission
- Push your completed files to the `alx_html_css` repository.
- Verify all links, assets, and styles render correctly.
